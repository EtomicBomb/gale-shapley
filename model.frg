//Galeâ€“Shapley algorithm

STEP 1: Step 1
--Each proposer proposes to his most preferred, acceptable receiver.
(if a proposer finds all receiver unacceptable they match to themselves).

--Each receiver who received at least one offer
temporarily holds the offer from the most preferred proposer among those
who made an offer to her and are acceptable rejects the other offer(s).


Step k, k â‰¥ 2

--Each proposer whose offer has been rejected in the previous step proposes to
his most preferred receiver among the acceptable receivers they has not yet
proposed to.
(if there is no such receiver they match to themselves).


--Each receiver who received at least one offer in this step
temporarily holds the offer from the most preferred proposer among
    1)those who made an offer to her in this step and are acceptable.
    2)the proposer she held from the previous step (if any).
rejects the other offer(s)


End: The algorithm stops when no proposer has an offer that is rejected.


Final matching:
Each receiver is matched to the proposer whose offer she was holding
when the algorithm stopped (if any).

Each proposer is matched to the receiver they were temporarily matched
when the algorithm stoped (if any).
